# ExpressLogin

Captive portal I am working on for my guest network in my apartment. The intent is to display a cool animation and integrate social media to increase followers and friends. This is a proof of concept that could be useful for businesses who offer free wifi to customers. Integrating social media ties to customers could lead to marketing data by scraping profile data for demographic information of their patrons.

## Using:
...Javascript/ECMAScript5/6
...Node.js
...Express
...Pug.js
...Canvas
...CSS

### Version 1.0
Frontend is coming together, canvas animation is scalable but the html template is not.

### TODO 
1. Integrate social media OAuth and/or friend request process
2. Create redirects with router captive portal process
3. Create scraping data middleware
4. Finish responsiveness and review frontend design and UI/UX flow before final release
